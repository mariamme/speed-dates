# speed-dating
The link to the shiny app https://mariammellouli.shinyapps.io/speed_dating/
\
For this project the source of the dataset I used was Kaggle.\
\
The first purpose of this project is to highlight the best or most popular features that usually attract participants to speed dates based on the scores given to each attribute by the opposite dates.\
The second purpose is to measure how self-confidence can influence how people perceive you by making correlations between the self-attributed scores and scores attributed by dates.\
\
Questions that the app will address:\
what are the expectations and auto-measure of the scores for every criteria for females and males ?\
what are the criteria of your predicted perfect match ?\
How does the score given by the partners to the people corresponding to the selected characteristics affect their decisions after the date ?\
\
Here are some screenshots of my shiny app:
